# RMP

A dashboard for analysis of the RMP website. This repository contains the files
used to build the
[lit-codes/rmp](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/litcodes/rmp) image.
The image contains the API and the front-end application based on
[Cube.js](https://cube.dev/) and PostgreSQL.

Local development is possible by putting the environment variables inside a
`.env` file in the root of this repo and running `npm start`. 

An example of such file is:

```
LOGIN_PASSWORD=[adminpassword] # Replace with a password to login from web
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=[rmppassword] # Replace with Redis password
CUBEJS_DB_HOST=localhost
CUBEJS_DB_NAME=rmp
CUBEJS_DB_USER=rmp
CUBEJS_DB_PASS=[dbpassword] # Replace with PostgreSQL password
CUBEJS_WEB_SOCKETS=true
CUBEJS_DB_TYPE=postgres
CUBEJS_API_SECRET=[apisecrethash] # Replace with the API secret created by the CubeJS CLI
```

# dashboard-app

This is the front-end application written in ReactJS and auto-generated by
CubeJS. In the future this will be our website and is probably hosted on either
Vercel or Netlify.

# index.js

This is our backend code, currently pretty dumb, and does nothing useful but
handling authentication and serving the front-end static content.

# Work-in-Progress

If you came accross this repo, please note that this is a work-in-progress and
at the moment it's not more than a proof-of-concept. Stay tuned for more.
